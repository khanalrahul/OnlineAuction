# OnlineAuctionSystem

Welcome to my project, Online Auction System, a Laravel-based web application designed to facilitate an online marketplace where buyers and sellers engage in product auctions. The system allows users to bid on listed products, with the highest bid within a set time period winning the auction. Once the auction time is finished, both the seller and the winning bidder(with highest bid abmount) are notified to proceed with payment and shipping arrangements of the product.

This project is actively maintained, and new features will be added regularly. Stay tuned for updates! I will be updating about its features on this.
